# Tomoflow
A toy CNN library written in numpy.

This is originally written for the coursework of Advanced Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

I find it's very interesting to write as a toy framework, which is flexible for the coursework purpose but not flexible for the general usage.

If I born 4 was years earlier, this may be more popular!
